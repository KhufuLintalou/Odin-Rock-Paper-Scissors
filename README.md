# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This was pretty hard. I wasted hours writing codes that i was confident gonna work, only for it to kinda fail at the end, prompting me to look up more "references" than i would like. 

Feels like there wasn't enough javascript practices before this project in the Odin course unlike the previous CSS lessons, but i don't know i slacked off pretty hard on the reading parts. In any case this was the practice that i needed and hopefully it helps me feel less like quitting in the future.
