# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This was pretty hard. I wasted hours writing codes that i was confident gonna work, only for it to kinda fail at the end, prompting me to look up more "references" than i would like. 

Feels like there wasn't enough javascript practices before this project in the Odin course unlike the previous CSS lessons, but i don't know i slacked off pretty hard on the reading parts. In any case this was the practice that i needed and hopefully it helps me feel less like quitting in the future.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Revisited

I just need to add some UI, how hard can it be ? Yeah... it was definitely not easy. The thing i struggled with the most was the javascript once again, but it wasn't as bad as the first time around, i think.
